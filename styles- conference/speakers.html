                        <h5>Designing A Culture Of Design</h5>

                        <p>
                            Workplace culture doesn't start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it
                            doesn't end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It's the unwritten rules, behavior,
                            beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it's what stifles a
                            workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to
                            work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Aaron's session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get*
                            design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, And
                            companies have that others don't, and more importantly, how to begin to change your
                            own workplace's culture. Once you've worked within a culture of design it's almost
                            impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

                        <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmakers</h5>
                        <p>
                            Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of
                            well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It's the filmakers's job to
                            put this together. To do so they've developed processes, tools and techniques that allow
                            them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce they many
                            elements that together comprise a well-told story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With this workshop, we'll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the 
                            technical aspects used in film to communicate. We'll look at some tools used in film, such
                            as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We'll consider why they're used
                            and how we might look to them for inspiration.
                        </p>
                        <h5>About Adam</h5>
                        <p>
                            Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration,
                            communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with
                            Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience
                            design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective
                            and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian
                            a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success.

                        <h5>The Business Of Play</h5>
                        <p>
                            Play isn&#8217;t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare account knows that
                            &#8211; and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience
                            isn&#8217;t about those surface elements either &#8211; it&#8217;s about creating an environment with well-
                            understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you&#8217;re trying to
                            encourage people &#8211; or yourself &#8211; to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game
                            mechanics and play could be the trump card you&#8217;re looking for.

                        <h5>Heavy Metal Coding</h5>

                        <p>
                            In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks
                            in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning - both of code and drum
                            beats! You'll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner's heavy metal drum
                            patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to
                            code frustration than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.

                            Creating in the face of negativity, fear, health problems, and your inner critic can at

                            them down, silence our inner critics, and talk about when it&#8217;s time to take a break or let

                        <p>
                            That first client meeting may not feel as warm and fulfilling as the first time you hold
                            your newborn child, but consider the similarities.

                        <p>
                            You know each other but have never met. As the relationship grows you will have to rely
                            on your experiences and education to gently guide them while allowing flexibility for
                            projects to change and evolve. It's not your job to control everything, but if you are
                            successful you will create a well-rounded piece that everyone involved can love.

                        <h5>From Muppets To Mastery:Core UX Principles From Mr. Jim Henson</h5>
                        <p>
                            Jim Henson started working as a puppeteer in 1954, a fair 40-50 years before many of
                            us even considered User Experience as a career. He did, however, take it upon himself
                            to apply many of the core principles that UX Designers are falling love with today (or are
                            at least using as part of our everyday lives). Hang out for a quick dive into the life of Jim
                            Henson, with a view into his work from the perspective of how it pertains to what it is
                            we're doing today, that promises to even leave Waldorf and Statler happy.

                        <p>
                            By setting constraints, we force ourselves to be more productive. They help us make
                            decisions, creating focus around the problem we are trying to solve. They improve our
                            consistency, which provides a better experience for our users. And they help us grow, a
                            valuable asset in times of innovation.

                        <h5>Leveling Up with Flexbox</h5>
                        <p>
                            By now, you&#8217;ve probably heard of &#8220;flexbox,&#8221; short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout
                            module and the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3&#8217;s wide array of new
                            layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without
                            having to worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we&#8217;ve dealt with for over a
                            decade. But with cross-browser support still incomplete, you&#8217;ve probably relegated
                            flexbox to the &#8220;one day&#8220; pile of web design tricks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It&#8217;s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you that it&#8217;s a good idea to
                            start learning and using flexbox today. You&#8217;ll learn how to take your designs &#8211; and web
                            design skills&#8211;to the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive enhancement,
                            adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.
